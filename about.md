# GStyle2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien

Soon to be the best customization mod for Geometry Dash.

## What is it?

GStyle2 is a continuation of the GStyle mod where you can change the way Geometry Dash looks except now it is now a lot better than ever. <cr>(GStyle will no longer be updated)</c>

## What's New?

Instead of a mod that changes properties of nodes only such as GStyle, we now have a better way of things so we are ditching the CSS format and you get to use something cooler while it being more simple.  
  
Instead of it being just a file, it now comes in Packs which are folders that contain .gstyle2 scripts, resources, etc.

## Features
- Sprite Creation
- Text Creation (Choose from a few built-in fonts)
- Audio Creation
- Shape Creation
- Change Node Properties <cy>(The same as GStyle)</c>
- and more coming up soon... <co>hopefully...</c>
